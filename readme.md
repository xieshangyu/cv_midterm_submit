After completing the multiple choice and short answer questions on the midterm, 
we also had to complete the programming questions on the exam. 
The following pictures are the output of the programming questions. 

In these tasks, I need to track the blue panels without red board.
I create a function named is_blue to finish this task. In this function, it will decide the scoreboard is blue or not.
I also need to show the relative coordinates of the blue board.
I transform the origin from left uppor corner to the center, and show the new coordinate on the screen.
